# Continue installation for medport project (2025-08-21 16:27Z)

_**User**_

I've started a new prject called medport. Can you continue the installtion? I believe I stopped at step three the backend setup. This project will be based on the setup for ChartCoach.

I'll help you continue the installation for your new medport project from where you left off at step 3 (backend setup). Let me first check the current state of your project to see what's already been done.
