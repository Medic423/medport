# Session Handoff: Multi-Agency Bidding Feature - In Progress

## Summary
Multi-agency bidding feature is partially implemented. EMS login and agency response creation are working. Full workflow testing still needed.

## Completed Today (2025-10-26)

### 1. Fixed Multi-Agency Bidding Database Issues
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating agency responses
- **Root Cause**: `AgencyResponse` foreign key was pointing to `trips` table, but data is stored in `transport_requests`
- **Fix**: Updated Prisma schema to reference `TransportRequest` model instead of `Trip` model
- **Database Fix**: Manually updated the foreign key constraint in the database to reference `transport_requests` instead of `trips`

### 2. Implemented Agency Response Creation
- **EMS Accept Flow**: When EMS clicks "Accept", it now creates an `AgencyResponse` record in the database ‚úÖ TESTED
- **EMS Decline Flow**: When EMS clicks "Decline", it creates a `DECLINED` response ‚úÖ TESTED  
- **Trip Status**: Trip remains `PENDING` until healthcare provider selects an agency
- **Backend Function**: Fixed `createAgencyResponse` in `tripService.ts` to actually persist data to database

### 3. Added Agency Selection Endpoint
- **New Endpoint**: Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
- **Functionality**: Healthcare providers can select which EMS agency gets the trip
- **Updates**: Selecting an agency marks it as selected, unselects others, and updates trip status to `ACCEPTED`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - ‚ùå NOT YET TESTED

### 4. Fixed EMS Login Issue
- **Issue**: EMS users getting 500 error on login
- **Root Cause**: Password hash mismatch in database
- **Fix**: Updated password hash in database to match "password" ‚úÖ TESTED
- **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging in EMS login to trace authentication issues

### 5. Updated Database Schema
- Updated Prisma schema relations:
  - `AgencyResponse` now correctly references `TransportRequest`
  - Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
  - Removed incorrect relation from `Trip` model
- Regenerated Prisma client
- Fixed database foreign key constraint

## Technical Changes

### Backend (`backend/src/`)
- **services/tripService.ts**:
  - Fixed `createAgencyResponse` to actually create database records ‚úÖ
  - Updated `selectAgencyForTrip` to accept responseId only
  - Added error logging with detailed error messages
  
- **routes/agencyResponses.ts**:
  - Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
  - Updated to pass correct parameters to `selectAgencyForTrip`
  - Added debug logging for request validation

- **routes/auth.ts**:
  - Added debug logging for EMS login process
  - Added password validation logging

### Prisma Schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Changed `AgencyResponse.trip` relation from `Trip` to `TransportRequest`
- Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
- Regenerated Prisma client to match schema

### Database
- Updated foreign key constraint: `agency_responses_tripId_fkey` now references `transport_requests(id)`
- Fixed EMS user password hash

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Verified Working**:
- Trip creation for multi-location healthcare providers
- EMS login (password updated in database)
- EMS agencies can accept/decline trips (creates AgencyResponse records)

‚è≥ **Implemented but NOT YET TESTED**:
- Healthcare providers seeing multiple agency responses
- Healthcare providers selecting an agency
- Selecting an agency updating trip status to ACCEPTED
- Unit assignment after agency selection
- Multiple agencies accepting the same trip

üîÑ **Next Steps**:
1. **Test Complete Workflow**:
   - Create a trip as healthcare provider
   - Have 2+ EMS agencies accept the trip
   - Verify healthcare provider sees multiple agency responses
   - Verify healthcare provider can select one agency
   - Verify selected agency gets the trip (others don't)
   - Verify unit assignment works after agency selection

2. **Edge Cases to Test**:
   - What happens when an agency accepts then the trip is selected by another agency?
   - What happens to "My Accepted Trips" for unselected agencies?
   - Time-based auto-selection if only one agency accepts

## Git Commits
1. "Fix multi-agency bidding: Update foreign key constraint and agency response creation" (e2fbea65)
2. "Fix EMS login and implement agency response creation (partial)" (67dad43c - amended)
3. "Update session handoff: Multi-agency bidding in progress" (59de7a82)

## Testing Notes
- Password for `doe@elkcoems.com` is now "password" (updated in database)
- Backend needs to be restarted after schema changes
- Agency responses now correctly linked to transport_requests table
- **Full workflow testing is the top priority for next session**
