# Session Handoff: Multi-Agency Bidding Feature - Still in Progress

## Context
Working on the "Agency Bidding Restoration - Phase 2" feature in the `feature/restore-agency-bidding` branch. Phase 1 (backend API) is complete. Phase 2 (frontend) is mostly complete but has a critical blocking issue.

## What We've Accomplished

### Completed:
1. **Unit Assignment Fix**: Fixed units 51 and 81 that had `isActive: false` causing "Invalid unit assignment" errors
2. **Manual Unit Status Control**: Added status dropdown to Edit Unit screen in Units Management
3. **Agency Ownership Validation**: Added validation to prevent editing units from other agencies
4. **Select/Reject Buttons**: Added UI for healthcare providers to select/reject agencies in the Healthcare Dashboard
5. **Improved Error Messages**: Added backend validation to return specific error messages instead of generic ones
6. **From Location Dropdown Fix**: Added key prop to force remount when switching tabs

### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/services/tripService.ts` - Added validation for pickup locations and healthcare locations
- `backend/src/routes/trips.ts` - Added check for `result.success` before returning
- `backend/src/services/unitService.ts` - Added agency ownership validation
- `backend/src/routes/units.ts` - Passes agencyId to updateUnit
- `frontend/src/components/HealthcareDashboard.tsx` - Added Select/Reject buttons for agency responses
- `frontend/src/components/EnhancedTripForm.tsx` - Added key prop and improved dropdown handling
- `frontend/src/types/units.ts` - Added status field to UnitFormData

## FIXED: "Selected facility not found" Error âœ…

### Solution:
Fixed the bug in `EnhancedTripForm.tsx` line 768-771 where it was looking up facilities in the wrong array. For multi-location users, it should search `healthcareLocations` instead of `facilities`.

Also fixed EMS accept/decline functionality in `EMSDashboard.tsx` to properly create `AgencyResponse` records instead of directly assigning units.

## Previous Issue (Now Fixed)

### Problem:
When creating a trip with:
- From Location: "Penn Highlands Elk - St. Marys, PA"
- Pickup Location: "Outpatient Surgery"
The error "Selected facility not found" appears in the console at `EnhancedTripForm.tsx:847`.

### What We Know:
1. The IDs being sent are correct (`fromLocationId: "loc_005"`, `pickupLocationId: "pickup-1760009478010-85myctz17"`)
2. "Outpatient Surgery" appears in the dropdown options, confirming it exists in the system
3. Backend has been updated with validation and detailed logging
4. Backend logs are NOT appearing when the trip is created (no "TCC_DEBUG: Validating pickup location:" logs)
5. Frontend console shows the generic error, not the specific backend error messages

### Hypothesis:
- Backend changes aren't being hit (old code still running?)
- Frontend is catching an error before it reaches the backend validation
- There's a Prisma relation issue with the `pickupLocation` or `healthcareLocation` connection

### Latest Changes Made:
Added detailed logging in `tripService.ts`:
```typescript
// Line 675: Added "TCC_DEBUG: Validating pickup location:" log
// Line 681: Added "TCC_DEBUG: Pickup location lookup result:" log  
// Line 693: Added "TCC_DEBUG: No pickupLocationId provided" log
```

But these logs are NOT appearing in the terminal output when creating a trip.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority:
1. **Debug why backend logs aren't appearing**: Check if the backend is actually running the latest code
2. **Try creating a trip again** and look for the validation logs in the backend terminal
3. **If logs still don't appear**: The backend might need a hard restart (kill all processes, rebuild, restart)

### If Backend Logs Appear:
- The logs will show which validation is failing (pickup location or healthcare location)
- Then we can fix that specific issue

### If Logs Still Don't Appear:
- Check if backend is running from a different directory/version
- Force recompile the backend: `cd backend && npm run build && npm run dev`
- Check backend terminal output vs frontend console for error messages

## Git Status
- Branch: `feature/restore-agency-bidding`
- Recent commits:
  - `8c53ca52` - fix: Properly return validation errors from trip creation endpoint
  - `55d0dfa9` - debug: Add detailed logging for pickup location and healthcare location validation
  - `a418a825` - feat: Add validation and better error messages for trip creation

## Database Context
- User is a multi-location healthcare provider (managesMultipleLocations: true)
- Has 10 healthcare locations configured
- Pickup location "Outpatient Surgery" has hospitalId: "loc_005"

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected**: When creating a trip, detailed backend logs should appear showing which location validation fails
**Actual**: No backend logs appear, frontend shows generic "Selected facility not found" error

## Key Files to Investigate
- `backend/src/services/tripService.ts` (lines 673-720) - Validation logic
- `backend/src/routes/trips.ts` (lines 195-204) - Error return logic
- `frontend/src/components/EnhancedTripForm.tsx` (line 847) - Where error is caught

---

**Action Items for Next Session:**
1. Verify backend is running latest code (check file timestamps)
2. Force restart/rebuild backend if needed
3. Try trip creation again and capture backend logs
4. If validation logs appear, fix the specific failing validation
5. If logs still don't appear, investigate why backend isn't receiving requests

**Hint**: The backend process ID is 3312 and should be running at `ts-node src/index.ts` in the backend directory. If no new logs appear, try killing it and doing a clean restart.
