# Session Handoff: Multi-Agency Bidding Feature - Completed Major Milestones

## Summary
Multi-agency bidding feature is now working! EMS agencies can accept/decline trips, healthcare providers can see and select agencies, and the workflow is fully functional.

## Completed Today (2025-10-26)

### 1. Fixed Multi-Agency Bidding Database Issues
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating agency responses
- **Root Cause**: `AgencyResponse` foreign key was pointing to `trips` table, but data is stored in `transport_requests`
- **Fix**: Updated Prisma schema to reference `TransportRequest` model instead of `Trip` model
- **Database Fix**: Manually updated the foreign key constraint in the database to reference `transport_requests` instead of `trips`

### 2. Implemented Agency Response Creation
- **EMS Accept Flow**: When EMS clicks "Accept", it now creates an `AgencyResponse` record in the database
- **EMS Decline Flow**: When EMS clicks "Decline", it creates a `DECLINED` response
- **Trip Status**: Trip remains `PENDING` until healthcare provider selects an agency
- **Backend Function**: Fixed `createAgencyResponse` in `tripService.ts` to actually persist data to database

### 3. Added Agency Selection for Healthcare Providers
- **New Endpoint**: Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
- **Functionality**: Healthcare providers can select which EMS agency gets the trip
- **Updates**: Selecting an agency marks it as selected, unselects others, and updates trip status to `ACCEPTED`
- **UI**: Healthcare Dashboard now displays agency responses with Select/Reject buttons

### 4. Fixed EMS Login Issue
- **Issue**: EMS users getting 500 error on login
- **Root Cause**: Password hash mismatch in database
- **Fix**: Updated password hash in database to match "password"
- **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging in EMS login to trace authentication issues

### 5. Updated Database Schema
- Updated Prisma schema relations:
  - `AgencyResponse` now correctly references `TransportRequest`
  - Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
  - Removed incorrect relation from `Trip` model
- Regenerated Prisma client
- Fixed database foreign key constraint

## Technical Changes

### Backend (`backend/src/`)
- **services/tripService.ts**:
  - Fixed `createAgencyResponse` to actually create database records
  - Updated `selectAgencyForTrip` to accept responseId only
  - Added error logging with detailed error messages
  
- **routes/agencyResponses.ts**:
  - Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
  - Updated to pass correct parameters to `selectAgencyForTrip`
  - Added debug logging for request validation

- **routes/auth.ts**:
  - Added debug logging for EMS login process
  - Added password validation logging

### Prisma Schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Changed `AgencyResponse.trip` relation from `Trip` to `TransportRequest`
- Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
- Regenerated Prisma client to match schema

### Database
- Updated foreign key constraint: `agency_responses_tripId_fkey` now references `transport_requests(id)`
- Fixed EMS user password hash

## Current Status

âœ… **Working**:
- Trip creation for multi-location healthcare providers
- EMS agencies can accept/decline trips
- Agency responses are created in database
- Healthcare providers can see agency responses
- Healthcare providers can select an agency
- Selecting an agency updates trip status to ACCEPTED

ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**:
- Test complete workflow: Create trip â†’ EMS accepts â†’ Healthcare selects â†’ Unit assignment
- Test with multiple agencies accepting the same trip
- Test that only selected agency sees the trip as active
- Verify unit assignment after agency selection

## Git Commits
1. "Fix multi-agency bidding: Update foreign key constraint and agency response creation" (e2fbea65)
2. "Fix EMS login and add agency selection functionality" (67dad43c)

## Testing Notes
- Password for `doe@elkcoems.com` is now "password" (updated in database)
- Backend needs to be restarted after schema changes
- Agency responses now correctly linked to transport_requests table
