# Session Handoff: Multi-Agency Bidding Feature - In Progress

## Summary
Multi-agency bidding feature is working! Multiple agencies can accept trips and healthcare providers can see all responses. Agency selection workflow still needs testing.

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Working (USER VERIFIED 2025-10-26)

### Verified by User:
- ‚úÖ EMS login is working (doe@elkcoems.com, password: "password")
- ‚úÖ Multiple agencies can accept trips (creates AgencyResponse records)
- ‚úÖ Healthcare providers see multiple agency responses in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Agency responses are properly displayed in the UI

## Completed Today (2025-10-26)

### 1. Fixed Multi-Agency Bidding Database Issues
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating agency responses
- **Root Cause**: `AgencyResponse` foreign key was pointing to `trips` table, but data is stored in `transport_requests`
- **Fix**: Updated Prisma schema to reference `TransportRequest` model instead of `Trip` model
- **Database Fix**: Manually updated the foreign key constraint in the database to reference `transport_requests` instead of `trips`

### 2. Implemented Agency Response Creation
- **EMS Accept Flow**: When EMS clicks "Accept", it creates an `AgencyResponse` record in the database ‚úÖ TESTED & VERIFIED
- **EMS Decline Flow**: When EMS clicks "Decline", it creates a `DECLINED` response ‚úÖ TESTED & VERIFIED
- **Trip Status**: Trip remains `PENDING` until healthcare provider selects an agency
- **Backend Function**: Fixed `createAgencyResponse` in `tripService.ts` to actually persist data to database

### 3. Added Agency Selection for Healthcare Providers
- **New Endpoint**: Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
- **Functionality**: Healthcare providers can select which EMS agency gets the trip
- **Updates**: Selecting an agency marks it as selected, unselects others, and updates trip status to `ACCEPTED`
- **UI**: Select/Reject buttons shown for each agency response
- **Status**: ‚è≥ IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING

### 4. Fixed EMS Login Issues
- **Issue**: EMS users getting authentication errors
- **Root Cause**: Password hash mismatches in database
- **Fix**: Updated password hashes for both doe@elkcoems.com and test@ems.com
- **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging in EMS login to trace authentication issues

### 5. Updated Database Schema
- Updated Prisma schema relations:
  - `AgencyResponse` now correctly references `TransportRequest`
  - Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
  - Removed incorrect relation from `Trip` model
- Regenerated Prisma client
- Fixed database foreign key constraint

## Current Status

‚úÖ **USER VERIFIED WORKING**:
- Trip creation for multi-location healthcare providers
- EMS login (passwords updated: doe@elkcoems.com and test@ems.com)
- EMS agencies can accept/decline trips (creates AgencyResponse records)
- Healthcare providers can see multiple agency responses in dashboard

‚è≥ **Implemented but Needs Testing**:
- Healthcare providers selecting an agency
- Selecting an agency updating trip status to ACCEPTED
- Unit assignment after agency selection  
- Multiple agencies accepting the same trip workflow

üîÑ **Next Steps**:
1. **Test Agency Selection Workflow**:
   - As healthcare provider, see if Select/Reject buttons appear
   - Click Select on one agency response
   - Verify trip status updates to ACCEPTED
   - Verify selected agency sees trip in their "Accepted Trips"
   - Verify unselected agencies don't see the trip as active

2. **Test Unit Assignment**:
   - After healthcare provider selects an agency
   - Log in as that selected EMS agency
   - Verify can assign a unit to the trip
   - Complete the workflow

3. **Edge Cases to Test**:
   - What happens when multiple agencies accept
   - What happens to unselected agencies
   - Verify trip doesn't move to "My Accepted Trips" until selection
   - Test time-based auto-selection (if implemented)

## Technical Changes

### Backend (`backend/src/`)
- **services/tripService.ts**:
  - Fixed `createAgencyResponse` to actually create database records ‚úÖ
  - Updated `selectAgencyForTrip` to accept responseId only
  - Added error logging with detailed error messages
  
- **routes/agencyResponses.ts**:
  - Added `POST /api/agency-responses/:id/select` endpoint
  - Updated to pass correct parameters to `selectAgencyForTrip`
  - Added debug logging for request validation
  - Fixed export to use `export default router;`

- **routes/auth.ts**:
  - Added debug logging for EMS login process
  - Added password validation logging

### Prisma Schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Changed `AgencyResponse.trip` relation from `Trip` to `TransportRequest`
- Added `agencyResponses` relation to `TransportRequest` model
- Removed incorrect relation from `Trip` model
- Regenerated Prisma client to match schema

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/`)
- **EMSDashboard.tsx**:
  - Updated `handleAcceptTrip` to create AgencyResponse first, then open unit modal
  - Updated `handleDeclineTrip` to create DECLINED AgencyResponse
  
- **HealthcareDashboard.tsx**:
  - Shows agency responses for each trip
  - Displays Select/Reject buttons for each agency
  - Has `handleSelectAgency` and `handleRejectAgency` functions

### Database
- Updated foreign key constraint: `agency_responses_tripId_fkey` now references `transport_requests(id)`
- Fixed EMS user passwords:
  - doe@elkcoems.com: password is "password"
  - test@ems.com (Altoona): password is "password"

1. "Fix multi-agency bidding: Update foreign key constraint and agency response creation" (e2fbea65)
2. "Fix EMS login and implement agency response creation (partial)" (8fbe5805 - amended)
3. "Update session handoff: Clarify testing status" (c00300fc)

## Backup Created
- **Backup**: tcc-backup-20251026_110640
- **Location**: 
  - External Drive: `/Volumes/Acasis/tcc-backups/tcc-backup-20251026_110640`
  - iCloud Drive: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/TCC-Backups/tcc-backup-20251026_110640`
- **Critical Scripts**: Updated in iCloud
- **Size**: 121M

## Testing Notes
- Password for `doe@elkcoems.com` and `test@ems.com` is "password"
- Backend needs to be running for testing
- Agency responses correctly linked to `transport_requests` table
- **DO NOT merge to main** - still needs end-to-end testing and cleanup

## Next Session Priorities
1. Test healthcare provider selecting an agency from multiple responses
2. Verify the selected agency workflow (unit assignment)
3. Test edge cases (what happens to unselected agencies)
4. Clean up debug logging
5. Final testing before considering merge to main
