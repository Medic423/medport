# Production Testing Recommendation

## Current Situation

**Working:**
- ✅ Login works for both test EMS users
- ✅ 6 EMS agencies synced
- ✅ 5 units synced  
- ✅ 38 agency responses imported

**Not Working:**
- ❌ Units API returning 500 errors
- ❌ Cannot save/create units
- ❌ Cannot update agency info

## Root Cause Analysis

The **Units** table has been a constant source of problems. You've correctly identified that:
- Healthcare users only care which **agency** accepted the trip
- The unit assignment is primarily an EMS internal detail

The 500 errors are likely because:
1. Production schema doesn't match development (missing `lastStatusUpdate` column)
2. The transformation logic expects fields that don't exist in production
3. This is preventing ALL save operations that touch the units table

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: **Remove Units Entirely** (RECOMMENDED)
- Remove unit selection from trip flow
- Healthcare only sees: "Which agency accepted?"
- EMS internal: Use their own systems for unit management
- **Pros**: Eliminates the problem source, simpler system
- **Cons**: Loses visibility into which unit is handling a trip

### Option B: **Fix the Units Issue**
- Determine exact schema difference between dev/prod
- Update code to handle missing columns gracefully
- Test thoroughly before deploying
- **Pros**: Keeps full functionality
- **Cons**: More complex, might break again

### Option C: **Simplified Units** (MIDDLE GROUND)
- Remove the detailed unit model
- Add simple text field: "Unit Number" on transport requests
- Healthcare sees: "Assigned Unit: 403" or "Unit Assignment Pending"
- No separate units table
- **Pros**: Balance between functionality and complexity
- **Cons**: Less detailed than full units system

## My Recommendation: **Option C**

Given your time constraints and the healthcare requirement (agencies matter, units don't), I recommend:

1. **Remove the Units Management entirely**
2. **Add simple unit assignment to transport requests**
3. **Let EMS manage units in their own systems**

This would:
- Fix the 500 errors immediately
- Give you a working production system
- Align with what healthcare actually cares about
- Be much simpler to maintain

## Next Steps

1. Should I remove the units table and all unit-related code?
2. Should I add simple "unitNumber" text field to transport requests?
3. Should we test this in dev first before pushing to production?

**Your call on which path to take.**
