## üöÄ **Phase 6.5: Plan to Restore Clean, Dedicated Login Flow and RBAC-Driven Landing**

**Date Started**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: üîÑ **PLANNING PHASE**  
**Previous Phase**: Phase 6.4.4 - Agency Portal Integration ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### **Problem Statement:**
The current system has login functionality mixed into the main navigation bar, causing:
- Complex state management issues
- localStorage conflicts between authentication and navigation
- Confusing user experience with login options always visible
- Navigation refresh problems due to mixed state

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Login Mixed with Main Navigation**: Login was integrated into the main navigation bar instead of being a separate, dedicated page
2. **State Management Complexity**: Authentication state was mixed with navigation state, creating complex bugs
3. **User Experience Confusion**: Users saw login options mixed with operational navigation
4. **Architectural Issues**: Violation of separation of concerns principle

### **Solution Approach:**
Implement a clean, dedicated login flow with proper separation between authentication and application navigation.

### **Phase 6.5 Implementation Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Dedicated Login Page (Restore, No Navbar Login)**
- **Objective**: Create/restore a dedicated login route/page as the app's entry point
- **Components**: 
  - `MainLogin.tsx` as the entry point (not via navbar)
  - Remove any login button from the primary navigation
- **Authentication Flows Supported**:
  - Transport Center
  - Hospitals  
  - Agencies
  - Developer/Demo bypass (only on login page, never in navbar)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Visiting the root shows the login page
  - No login elements appear in the main navbar

#### **Phase 2: Post-Login Routing (Role- and Visibility-Aware)**
- **Objective**: Implement single post-auth router with role-based landing
- **Implementation**:
  - Read userType + role from login result or demo credentials mapping
  - Load module visibility via `useRoleBasedAccess` or corresponding API
  - Determine "first accessible module" as the landing page
- **Role-to-Landing Examples**:
  - Transport Center (Command): `status-board`
  - Hospitals: `transport-requests` or agency/hospital dashboard
  - Agencies: `agency-portal`
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - After login, user lands on correct module for their role and visibility
  - Refresh preserves current page without falling back to non-existent "home"

#### **Phase 3: Module Visibility + RBAC Re-Enable (Minimal Viable)**
- **Objective**: Reconnect Settings to confirm visibility is flowing
- **Implementation**:
  - Only ADMIN/Command sees full Settings
  - Coordinators/Hospitals/Agencies see minimal appropriate set
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Toggling visibility in Settings affects navbar modules
  - Navbar hides modules based on visibility settings

#### **Phase 4: Developer/Demo Access (Safe, Isolated)**
- **Objective**: Add developer/demo option safely isolated to login page
- **Implementation**:
  - Available only on login page (not navbar)
  - Either "Developer (Bypass)" button or "Command" preset in Transport Center path
  - Clear visual indicator on login page only
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Demo/dev mode does not pollute application navigation
  - Switching off demo resets auth state cleanly

#### **Phase 5: Stability, Documentation, and Checkpoints**
- **Objective**: Add guards and documentation
- **Implementation**:
  - Avoid storing invalid `currentPage` in localStorage
  - Default to first visible module
  - Keep login state separate from navigation state
- **Documentation**: Update `medport_plan.md` with changes after each phase confirmation

### **Implementation Order and Checkpoints:**
1. **Phase 1**: Dedicated login page as landing (test ‚Üí confirm)
2. **Phase 2**: Post-login routing to role/visibility-based landing (test ‚Üí confirm)  
3. **Phase 3**: Re-enable module visibility (minimal path) (test ‚Üí confirm)
4. **Phase 4**: Add developer/demo only on login page (test ‚Üí confirm)
5. **Phase 5**: Final QA + documentation updates (after confirmation)

### **Technical Notes:**
- Use `demo_credentials.md` to map Transport Center, Hospital, Agency (and Command) flows
- Keep current clean navbar; no login or developer buttons in it
- Maintain separation between authentication state and navigation state
- Each phase requires user testing and confirmation before proceeding

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between login and main application
- ‚úÖ Role-based landing pages based on module visibility
- ‚úÖ No localStorage conflicts between auth and navigation
- ‚úÖ Developer/demo access isolated to login page only
- ‚úÖ Settings module controls navbar visibility correctly

**Ready to proceed with Phase 1: Dedicated Login Page Implementation** üö™üîê

### Current System Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Port 3002)

## üöÄ **Phase 6.6: Enhanced Module Visibility & Category Management**

### **Objective**: Implement hierarchical category-level visibility controls for more granular module management

**Date Started**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: üéØ **PLANNING PHASE**  
**Previous Phase**: Phase 6.5 Phase 2 - Role-Based Access Control System ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### **Problem Statement:**
Current Module Visibility tab only shows individual modules without the category structure that users see in navigation. Missing categories like "Financial Planning" and unable to control visibility at category level.

### **Proposed Solution:**
Implement hierarchical visibility controls that show both categories and sub-modules, allowing admins to:
- Control visibility at category level (affects all sub-modules)
- Maintain granular control at individual module level
- See the complete navigation structure in Settings

### **Implementation Phases:**

#### **Phase 6.6.1: Extend Data Model** üîß
- [ ] Add `category` field to module visibility settings
- [ ] Add `parentCategory` field for sub-modules  
- [ ] Extend `ModuleVisibilitySettings` interface
- [ ] **Safety**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Existing module-level settings continue to work

#### **Phase 6.6.2: Update Backend Service** ‚öôÔ∏è
- [ ] Enhance `RoleBasedAccessService.getModuleVisibilitySettings()`
- [ ] Add new endpoint for category-level visibility
- [ ] Maintain existing module-level endpoints
- [ ] **Safety**: All existing API calls continue to work
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Backend returns category information without breaking existing functionality

#### **Phase 6.6.3: Frontend UI Enhancement** üé®
- [ ] Add category headers in Module Visibility tab
- [ ] Show sub-modules indented under categories
- [ ] Add category-level checkboxes (affects all sub-modules)
- [ ] **Safety**: UI changes don't affect existing functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Module Visibility tab shows complete category structure

#### **Phase 6.6.4: Navigation Integration** üß≠
- [ ] Update navigation generation to respect category visibility
- [ ] Hide entire categories if they're disabled
- [ ] Maintain existing module-level fallbacks
- [ ] **Safety**: Navigation gracefully degrades if category settings fail
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Navigation automatically adapts to category-level settings

### **Expected UI Structure:**
```
Financial Planning [‚úì] (Category checkbox)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analytics & Reporting [‚úì] (Module checkbox)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Resource Management [‚úì] (Module checkbox)

Dispatch Operations [‚úì] (Category checkbox)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transport Requests [‚úì] (Module checkbox)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Status Board [‚úì] (Module checkbox)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Route Optimization [‚úì] (Module checkbox)
```

### **Safety Measures to Prevent Side Effects:**
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing module-level settings continue to work
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement one phase at a time with testing
3. **Fallback Logic**: If category settings fail, fall back to module-level settings
4. **Data Migration**: Existing settings automatically get default category assignments
5. **Testing Strategy**: Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next

### **Benefits:**
- **Better Organization**: Admins can see the full structure
- **Easier Management**: Toggle entire categories on/off
- **Granular Control**: Still control individual modules if needed
- **User Experience**: Navigation automatically adapts to category settings
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new categories and modules

### **Potential Challenges:**
1. **Complexity**: More complex state management in the frontend
2. **Performance**: Slightly more API calls for category-level operations
3. **Data Consistency**: Need to ensure category and module settings don't conflict

### **Implementation Order:**
1. **Phase 6.6.1**: Extend data model (Safe - no functional changes)
2. **Phase 6.6.2**: Backend enhancements (Safe - API compatibility maintained)
3. **Phase 6.6.3**: Frontend UI changes (Safe - existing functionality preserved)
4. **Phase 6.6.4**: Navigation integration (Safe - fallback logic implemented)

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All existing module-level settings continue to work
- [ ] Category-level visibility controls are functional
- [ ] Module Visibility tab shows complete navigation structure
- [ ] Navigation automatically adapts to category settings
- [ ] No system-wide side effects from implementation
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] User experience is improved for admins
