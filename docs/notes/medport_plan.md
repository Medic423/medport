# MedPort Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
MedPort is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to coordinate interfacility EMS transfers, optimizing ambulance availability, loaded miles, and routing efficiency across hospital service areas.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based PWA with offline capabilities
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma schema
- **Deployment**: Render for production (frontend + backend)
- **Offline Support**: Workbox service workers with localStorage persistence

## Revenue Optimization Goals
**CRITICAL FEATURE**: Distance & Route Optimization System
