**Next Steps Required:**
1. Investigate actual database state of transport requests and units
2. Verify enum values match between code and database
3. Add more detailed logging to optimization process
4. Test data reset script to ensure clean unassigned state
5. Debug why optimization queries are not finding expected data

**Status**: Phase 4.4 is functionally complete but requires debugging to resolve the optimization data finding issue. Core functionality works, authentication is fixed, but optimization logic needs investigation to understand why no assignments are being created.

- Payment processing for agency billing (future)

### Offline Capabilities
- Service worker implementation
- Local storage for critical data
- Background sync for updates
- Conflict resolution for offline changes
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Test Data Management
- Empty test data files for development
- No hardcoded dummy data to maintain clean data pipeline
- Automated test data generation scripts
- Test data cleanup and reset procedures
- Environment-specific test data sets

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Route optimization complexity**: Start with simple algorithms, iterate
- **Real-time synchronization**: Implement robust conflict resolution
- **Mobile performance**: Extensive testing on various devices
- **API rate limits**: Implement caching and request throttling

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Provide comprehensive training and support
- **Data accuracy**: Implement validation and verification systems
- **Compliance requirements**: Regular security audits and updates
- **Integration challenges**: Phased approach with fallback options
