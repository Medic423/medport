# Plan for Next Session - August 25, 2025

## 🎯 **Session Goal: Fix Unit Assignment Optimization Button**

The "Run Optimization" button in the Unit Assignment Dashboard is now working (no more 401 errors) but returns 0 assignments created. Need to investigate why no data is being found for optimization.

## 🔍 **Current Status Summary**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- Backend server is running on port 5001
- Demo data creation scripts executed successfully (5 facilities, 2 agencies, 5 units, 6 transport requests, 20 distance matrix entries)
- Authentication is working (demo mode middleware properly handles `Bearer demo-token`)
- Frontend can successfully reach backend API endpoints
- Optimization endpoint returns 200 status (no more 401 errors)

### ❌ **What's Not Working:**
- Optimization button runs successfully but finds 0 assignments to create
- Returns: "Optimization completed: 0 assignments created, $0.00 revenue increase"
- No error messages in console logs

## 🛠️ **Technical Details for Next Session**

### **Backend Files Modified:**
1. **`backend/src/services/unitAssignmentService.ts`** - Enhanced with better error handling and logging
2. **`backend/src/routes/unitAssignment.ts`** - Fixed demo mode middleware to handle `Bearer demo-token`
3. **`frontend/src/components/UnitAssignmentDashboard.tsx`** - Added detailed logging and error handling

### **Key Changes Made:**
- **Demo Middleware Fix**: Now properly handles `Authorization: Bearer demo-token` format
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout optimization process
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and debugging information

### **Database State:**
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Demo data exists: 5 facilities, 2 agencies, 5 units, 6 transport requests, 20 distance matrix entries
- Reset script created: `backend/scripts/reset-demo-data.js`

## 🚀 **Next Session Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Investigate Data State**
- Check if transport requests are actually in PENDING status
- Verify units are in AVAILABLE status
- Check for any data inconsistencies between schema and actual data

### **Step 2: Debug Optimization Logic**
- Add more detailed logging to see exactly what data is being found
- Check if the optimization query is working correctly
- Verify the data types and enum values match between database and code

### **Step 3: Test Data Reset**
- Run the reset script: `node scripts/reset-demo-data.js`
- Verify data is properly reset to unassigned state
- Test optimization button again

### **Step 4: Manual Database Inspection**
- Use Prisma Studio or direct database queries to inspect data
- Check transport request statuses and assignedUnitId values
- Check unit currentStatus values

## 🔧 **Commands to Run Next Session**

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /Users/scooper/Code/medport/backend

# Check if server is running
npm start

# In another terminal, run reset script
node scripts/reset-demo-data.js

# Test optimization button in frontend
# Check both frontend and backend console logs
```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

- Optimization button should find 6 unassigned transport requests
- Should find 5 available units (BLS, ALS, CCT)
- Should create 6 assignments successfully
- Should show revenue calculations and assignment details
- Backend logs should show detailed optimization process

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Optimization button creates actual assignments (not 0)
- [ ] Backend logs show detailed optimization process
- [ ] Frontend displays success message with assignment count and revenue
- [ ] Database shows assignments created and statuses updated

## 📝 **Files to Focus On**

1. **`backend/src/services/unitAssignmentService.ts`** - Core optimization logic
2. **`backend/src/routes/unitAssignment.ts`** - API endpoint and middleware
3. **`frontend/src/components/UnitAssignmentDashboard.tsx`** - Frontend integration
4. **Database state** - Check actual data values and statuses

## 🔍 **Debugging Approach**

1. **Add more logging** to see exactly what data is found
2. **Check database state** directly to verify data exists
3. **Test with minimal data** to isolate the issue
4. **Verify enum values** match between code and database

This session should focus on getting the optimization to actually find and process the demo data, rather than just running successfully with no results.
