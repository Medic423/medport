# MedPort Reorganization Implementation Tracker

## üéØ **Project Overview**
**Goal**: Simplify MedPort from complex role-based system to focused Transfer Optimization Platform
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Date Created**: August 29, 2025
**Git Strategy**: New branch `feature/simplified-system` to preserve complex system as reference

## üß† **Core Mission Restatement**I'm 

1. **Maximize EMS efficiency & revenue** by batching, routing, and assigning inter-facility transports to minimize downtime, empty miles, and billing denials
2. **Save hospitals money** by removing nurse/case manager from "phone tree," reducing wasted clinical hours and freeing staff for patient care

## üèóÔ∏è **Target Architecture: Three Simple User Types**

### **1. Hospitals & Healthcare Facilities**
- **Purpose**: Post transfer requests and monitor trip status
- **Core Functions**:
  - Trip entry with essential data points
  - Trip status monitoring dashboard
  - Basic notification system
  - Trip cancellation capability
- **Data Points**:
  - Origin & Destination
  - Time of Transfer Request
  - Time Transfer Accepted
  - Time of EMS Arrival
  - Time Lapse between Acceptance and Arrival
  - Transport Level (ALS/BLS/CCT)
- **Menu**: Simplified, focused only on trip management

### **2. EMS & Transport Agencies**
- **Purpose**: View and accept trips, optimize routes
- **Core Functions**:
  - View all trips in system with filtering
  - Accept/decline trips with ETA
  - Route optimization tools
  - Insurance optimizer for billing
- **Trip Response**: Accept/Decline + ETA for crew arrival
- **Menu**: Trip viewing, route optimization, agency tools

### **3. Transport Operations Coordination Center (TOCC)**
- **Purpose**: Oversee all trips, expedite operations, manage system
- **Core Functions**:
  - Full visibility of all hospital and EMS modules
  - Trip oversight and management
  - Feature toggle system for additional modules
  - System monitoring and optimization
- **Menu**: Access to everything + admin controls

## üöÄ **Freemium Account Creation Model**
- **Self-Service Registration**: Users can create accounts with two basic types
  - Hospital/Healthcare
  - EMS/Transport
- **Free Tier**: Core mission functionality (trip posting, acceptance, basic optimization)
- **Paid Features**: Advanced modules and complex features available through Transport Center
- **Growth Strategy**: Zero-friction adoption leads to paid feature upsells

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Simplify Login & User Type System**
**Goal**: Remove complex role-based routing, implement simple user type determination

#### **1.1 Simplify Authentication System**
- [x] Remove complex role-based access control middleware
- [x] Implement simple user type field (hospital/ems/center)
- [x] Remove dynamic navigation fetching
- [x] Simplify login flow to three clear paths
- [x] Remove complex permission validation
- [x] Test basic login functionality

**‚úÖ Phase 1.1 COMPLETED - August 29, 2025**
- **Created**: `simpleAuth.ts` middleware with user type determination
- **Created**: `simpleNavigationService.ts` for static menu generation  
- **Created**: `simpleNavigation.ts` routes for simplified endpoints
- **Created**: `useSimpleNavigation.ts` hook to replace complex role-based access
- **Updated**: `App.tsx` to use simplified navigation system
- **Added**: Backward compatibility for legacy role mapping
- **Result**: JSON.parse error resolved by eliminating complex dynamic navigation fetching

#### **1.2 Simplify Menu System**
- [x] Replace dynamic role-based navigation with static user type menus
- [x] Create Hospital menu: Trip entry, monitoring, basic functions
- [x] Create EMS menu: Trip viewing, route optimization, agency tools
- [x] Create Center menu: Full access + admin controls
- [x] Remove complex navigation components
- [x] Test menu display for each user type

**‚úÖ Phase 1.2 COMPLETED - August 29, 2025**
- **Created**: `HospitalDashboard.tsx` - Trip monitoring and management dashboard
- **Created**: `NewTripForm.tsx` - Comprehensive trip creation form with validation
- **Created**: `TripManagement.tsx` - Full trip management with filtering and search
- **Updated**: `App.tsx` routing to use new simplified components
- **Implemented**: Core mission functionality: trip entry, monitoring, and management
- **Added**: Mock data for demonstration and testing
- **Result**: Clean, focused interface focused on hospital trip management needs

#### **1.4 Fix JWT Token Structure and Backend Issues - August 29, 2025**
**Goal**: Resolve JWT token compatibility and backend compilation issues

- [x] **Fix JWT Token Structure**: Add `userType` field to all JWT tokens
  - Transport Center: `userType: 'center'`
  - Hospital: `userType: 'hospital'`
  - Agency: `userType: 'ems'`
  - Maintains backward compatibility with `role` field
- [x] **Fix Backend Compilation**: Resolve TypeScript errors in agency routes
  - Added `jwt` import to `agency.ts`
  - Fixed JWT token generation for all login endpoints
- [x] **Resolve Port Conflicts**: Clean up multiple backend processes
  - Killed conflicting processes causing `EADDRINUSE` errors
  - Clean restart of both backend and frontend services
- [x] **Verify Backend Functionality**: Test simplified navigation endpoints
  - ‚úÖ `/api/simple-navigation/navigation` returns correct user type and menu
  - ‚úÖ `/api/simple-navigation/landing-page` returns correct landing page path
  - ‚úÖ JWT tokens now properly include `userType` field

**‚úÖ Phase 1.4 COMPLETED - August 29, 2025**
- **Result**: Backend now correctly identifies user types and generates navigation
- **Result**: JWT tokens include proper `userType` field for simplified authentication
- **Result**: No more TypeScript compilation errors or port conflicts
- **Remaining Issue**: Landing page still not loading despite correct backend responses

#### **1.5 Current Setback: Landing Page Not Loading - August 29, 2025**
**Issue**: Despite fixing all backend issues, the frontend still doesn't load the landing page after successful login

**What We've Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **CORS Issues**: Resolved by forcing local development API URL in vite config
- ‚úÖ **JWT Token Structure**: Fixed to include proper `userType` field
- ‚úÖ **Backend Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ **Navigation API**: Working correctly, returns proper user type and menu
- ‚úÖ **Menu Display**: Navigation menu shows correctly with all 6 items for center users

**Current Problem:**
- ‚ùå **Landing Page**: After login, user sees navigation menu but no content loads
- ‚ùå **Routing**: Frontend doesn't navigate to `/overview` despite backend returning correct path
- ‚ùå **User Experience**: Users can see they're logged in but can't access any functionality

**Technical Status:**
- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Fully functional, all endpoints working
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Starts correctly, navigation menu displays
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ JWT tokens working, user type correctly identified
- **Routing**: ‚ùå Landing page routing not working

**Next Steps Required:**
- Investigate frontend routing logic in `App.tsx` and `useSimpleNavigation` hook
- Check if landing page component (`/overview` route) exists and is properly configured
- Verify that the frontend is actually calling the landing page API endpoint
- Debug why the routing isn't working despite correct backend responses
