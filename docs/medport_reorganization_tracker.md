- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ HospitalDashboard now renders properly with navigation functionality
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ JWT tokens include proper `userType` field for all user types
- **Navigation**: ‚úÖ Hospital users see proper navigation menu and landing page
- **Routing**: ‚úÖ Hospital dashboard displays with trip management interface

**Siloing Verification:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Isolation Confirmed**: Each user type has separate endpoints and database queries
- ‚úÖ **Center Login**: `/center-login` ‚Üí `COORDINATOR` role ‚Üí `userType: 'center'` ‚Üí System Overview
- ‚úÖ **Hospital Login**: `/hospital-login` ‚Üí `ADMIN` role ‚Üí `userType: 'hospital'` ‚Üí Dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Agency Login**: `/agency-login` ‚Üí `TRANSPORT_AGENCY` role ‚Üí `userType: 'ems'` ‚Üí Available Trips
- ‚úÖ **Protection Confirmed**: Center and hospital logins completely protected from agency login work

**Result**: Hospital login now works end-to-end with proper dashboard display and navigation

**‚úÖ Phase 1.7 COMPLETED - August 30, 2025**
