# Email Instructions for Designer - Landing Page Assets

**Subject:** Landing Page Implementation - Assets & Specifications Needed

---

Hi Sophia,

We've built the complete structure for the TraccEMS landing page and now need the design assets and specifications from Figma to match your design exactly. 

Here's exactly what we need:

---

## 1. Screenshots (10 minutes)

Please take 3 full-page screenshots:

1. **Desktop View** - Full landing page as it appears on desktop
   - File name: `landing-desktop.png`
   - How: Use browser screenshot or Figma's export feature

2. **Mobile View** - Full landing page as it appears on mobile
   - File name: `landing-mobile.png`
   - How: Switch to mobile frame in Figma, then screenshot

3. **Process Section Close-up** - The 3-step process section (Request, Match, Transport)
   - File name: `process-section.png`
   - How: Zoom in on that section, screenshot

**Why:** These help us verify the final implementation matches your design exactly.

## 2. Design Specifications (15 minutes)

Please create a simple text document with the following:

### Colors (Hex Codes)
For each color used in the design, please provide:
- Primary color: #XXXXXX
- Secondary color: #XXXXXX
- Text color (headings): #XXXXXX
- Text color (body): #XXXXXX
- Link color: #XXXXXX
- Background colors: #XXXXXX
- Any accent colors: #XXXXXX

**How to get hex codes in Figma:**
- Click on any element with the color
- In the right panel, click the color fill/stroke
- Copy the hex code (e.g., #2563EB)

### Typography
For each text style, please provide:
- **Hero headline:** Font family, size (px), weight, line height
- **Hero subheadline:** Font family, size (px), weight, line height
- **Section headings (h2):** Font family, size (px), weight, line height
- **Body text:** Font family, size (px), weight, line height
- **Button text:** Font family, size (px), weight
- **Navigation links:** Font family, size (px), weight

**How to get typography in Figma:**
- Select text element
- Right panel shows: Font name, Size, Weight, Line height
- Just copy those values

### Spacing
Please note:
- **Section padding:** Top and bottom padding for each section (e.g., 80px, 120px)
- **Container max-width:** Maximum width of content (e.g., 1280px)
- **Grid gaps:** Spacing between cards/elements (e.g., 32px, 24px)
- **Card padding:** Internal padding for cards (e.g., 24px, 32px)

**How to get spacing in Figma:**
- Select a section/card
- Right panel shows padding values
- Note the values

## 3. Assets Export (10 minutes)

- Select logo
- Right-click → Export → PNG or SVG → Export
- File name: `logo.png` or `logo.svg`

  - Transport icon → `icon-transport.svg`
- If you used standard icons (Font Awesome, Material, etc.), just tell us which library and icon names

## Questions?

If anything is unclear or you need help exporting, just let me know! 

**Timeline:** We're ready to integrate as soon as we receive these assets, so the sooner you can provide them, the faster we can complete the implementation.

Thank you!

**Note:** We've already implemented the structure and content based on what we could see in the design. We just need the visual specifications and assets to match your design exactly.
