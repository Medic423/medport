## Issues to Fix

### 1. CRITICAL: Fix Terms URL ⚠️

**Current:** `https://traccems.com/term`  
**Should be:** `https://traccems.com/terms`

**Steps:**
1. Go back to the "Program Content" section
2. Find "Terms and conditions URL" field
3. Change `/term` to `/terms`
4. Verify it shows: `https://traccems.com/terms`

### 2. Verify Volume Number

**Question:** What time period does "Expected total messages sent: 10,000" refer to?
- Annual (12 months)?
- Campaign duration?
- First year?

**Your estimate:** 2,500 messages/month = 30,000/year

**If Azure is asking for annual total:**
- Consider updating to 30,000 or higher
- Or clarify if 10,000 is for a shorter period

**If 10,000 is correct:**
- No change needed
