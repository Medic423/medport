## Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Azure Portal Support (Try This First)

Even if you can't create a support ticket through the normal flow, try these approaches:

#### Option A: Azure Portal Help + Support

1. **Go to Azure Portal:**
   - Navigate to: https://portal.azure.com
   - Click **"Help + Support"** in the top menu
   - Try **"New support request"** again

2. **If that doesn't work, try:**
   - Look for **"Contact support"** or **"Get help"** options
   - Check if there's a chat option
   - Look for **"Billing and subscription support"** (sometimes this works when technical support doesn't)

#### Option B: Direct Communication Services Support

1. **Navigate to your Communication Services resource:**
   - Go to: **Communication Services** → **TraccComms**
   - Look for **"Support"** or **"Help"** options in the resource menu
   - Check for **"New support request"** specific to Communication Services

#### Option C: Subscription-Level Support

1. **Go to Subscription:**
   - Navigate to: **Subscriptions** → Select your subscription
   - Click **"Support + troubleshooting"** → **"New support request"**
   - Sometimes subscription-level support works when resource-level doesn't

### Method 2: Azure Support Email (Alternative)

Try these Microsoft support email addresses:

**Option 1: General Azure Support**
- **Email:** `azure-support@microsoft.com`
- **Subject:** Cancel Toll-Free Verification Application 513670f8-6b42-4ead-8973-ae2a58ba7096

**Option 2: Communication Services Specific**
- Check Azure Portal for Communication Services specific support email
- Look in: Communication Services → TraccComms → Support section

### Method 3: Azure Support Phone

**Call Azure Support:**
- **US Phone:** 1-800-867-1389
- **Hours:** Monday-Friday, 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM PST
- **Have ready:**
  - Application ID: `513670f8-6b42-4ead-8973-ae2a58ba7096`
  - Subscription ID: `fb5dde6b-779f-4ef5-b457-4b4d087a48ee`
  - Resource details

### Method 4: Azure Community Forum

**Post in Azure Community:**

- **Or:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/products/azure
- Post your question about canceling the application

### Method 5: Check Portal for Direct Cancel Option

**In Azure Portal:**
1. Go to: **Communication Services** → **TraccComms** → **Regulatory Documents**
2. Click on the application: `513670f8-6b42-4ead-8973-ae2a58ba7096`
3. Look for:
   - **"Cancel"** button (you already tried this)
   - **"Withdraw"** button
   - **"Delete"** button
   - **"Remove"** button
   - Any other action buttons

4. **If Cancel button opens dialog:**
   - Try clicking **"Cancel"** in the dialog (not "Send an email")
   - See if there's a direct cancel option without email

### Method 6: Azure CLI (If Available)

**Check if Azure CLI has a command:**
```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Check available commands for Communication Services
az communication --help

# Check regulatory documents commands
az communication regulatory-document --help
```

**Note:** This may not be available, but worth checking.

   - See if it allows creating a new application for the same phone number

2. **If new application is allowed:**
