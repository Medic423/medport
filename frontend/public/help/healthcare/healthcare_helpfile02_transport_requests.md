### Transport Requests
![alt text](image_url_or_relative_path)
#### Overview
After a transport request has been created it is automatically assigned to the **Transport Requests** screen.  Here you can:
- Examine trip details
- Scroll through a list of all pending trips
- See the status of each trip
- Edit all the data points for a trip 
- Dispatch future trips
- Mark a trip complete
- Delete a trip

### Screen Layout
Under the menu bar are three status displays that update automatically. These data tiles show:
- The number of pending requests of all types
- How many trips have been completed
- The number of **Emergent** trips

Under the data tiles is the list of all pending **Transport Requests**created by your facility. The listing is dynamically sorted into different sections by date and time. Typically there will be a **Today's Trips** at the top, followed by a **Future Trips** section and a **Past Trips** section at the bottom. 

This list has the potential to become very long so filtering options are provided to help you shorten the list or help you find a specific trip. The filtering options are:
- All Status
- Pending
- Accepted
- Declined
- In Progress
- Cancelled

### The Trip Listing
Each trip listing is divided into two sections. The section on the left are the **Trip Details**. On the right side are the trip status labels and action buttons. At the bottom is a trip acceptance indicator. 

- **Trip Details**
  - Patient Identifier 
  - Requested Pickup Time
  - Trip origin and destination. In a Healthcare Group a transport center, or a variety of individuals may be dispatching trips for a number of hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation facilities or physician offices.  
  - The location for patient pickup and contact information 
  - Type of response required - BLS, ALS, or Critical Care
  - Time the trip was created in "Create Request"
  
- **Actions & Labels**
  - Trip Status - Routine, Urgent (Configurable in Hospital Settings) 
  - Trip Acceptance Indicator - Pending, Accepted, In Progress, Pending Dispatch  
  - Dispatch trip to EMS agencies - Only visible for future and past trips
  - Edit trip - Tapping the Blue Pen & Paper Icon will let present the user with a dialog screen where changes can be made to the trip's settings
  - Trip Completion - At the end of the trip creation and acceptance process tapping the green check mark icon updates the trip status to complete and moves the trip the **Completed Trips** listing. 
  - Delete - Tapping the trash icon removes the trip from the system.  

- **Trip Acceptance**
In the bottom left of the trip display you can review agency responses or lack of response for a trip. Details on how to select an agency from multiple bids will be covered in a later section. It will also show an indicator for whether the trip has been accepted by the healthcare organization that created the trip. 
  - See the number of agencies have responded
  - View response status (ACCEPTED, DECLINED, PENDING)

### Dispatching a Trip
Only trips with a date in the future can be dispatched from this screen. Trip requests with a current date were sent to the EMS or other transport provider when the trip was created. Trips that haven't been dispatched are labeled with a grey pill labeled PENDING_DISPATCH. There is a purple arrow next to the PENDING_DISPATCH pill that when tapped will present you with the dispatch sequence.  See [Create Request](./helpfile01_create-request.md) for complete details on how trips are dispatched.
