### In-Progress 

#### Track active transports
Once a trip has been accepted in the **Transport Requests** list the trip automatically advances to the **In-Progress** list. The **In-Progress** list focuses on completion times for the major milestones of a trip. 

### The In-Progress Listing
Each trip listing is divided into three sections. The section on the left has the **Trip Details**. On the right side is an action button that changes as the trip progresses. At the bottom is a timing strip that updates as various stages of the trip are completed. 

#### Key Features
- **Active Trip List**
  - Trips with status: ACCEPTED, IN_PROGRESS
  - Real-time status updates
  - Agency assignment information
- **Status Tracking**
  - Pickup timestamp
  - Arrival timestamp
  - Departure timestamp
  - Estimated arrival time

#### Action Button
The initial state of the button is **Mark Arrival**.
- Tap this button when EMS or another transport provider arrives at the designated pick-up location. 
- This will update the **Arrival Time** and the button will switch to **Mark Completed**. 
The other use of **Mark Completed** is when a patient leaves the pick-up location. 

**Note:** How each facility uses **Mark Completed** may be dictated by a protocol or procedure. 
For example in a multi-facility group a patient in ICU is being transferred to a hospital with a lower level of care inside that hospital group. The hospital receiving the patient would mark the trip complete when the patient arrives at their facility. This would give the hospital system metrics for how long it takes for a complete trip.
