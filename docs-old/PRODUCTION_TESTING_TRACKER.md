## üêõ **Issues Found**

### **Critical Issues** (Block usage)
**Issue #1: Destination dropdown is empty** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Location**: Healthcare Portal > Create Trip > "To Location" dropdown
- **Expected**: Should show list of facilities (hospitals, clinics, etc.)
- **Actual**: Dropdown is empty, no options to select
- **Root Cause**: Table mismatch - facilities service queried `facility` table but healthcare registration creates records in `hospital` table
- **Impact**: Cannot create trips - blocks core functionality
- **Investigation**: 
  - ‚úÖ Backend health check: healthy
  - ‚úÖ Geographic filtering bypassed temporarily
  - üîç Found table mismatch: facilities service vs healthcare registration
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Updated facilities service to query `hospital` table instead of `facility` table
  - Deployed backend and frontend with new API URL
  - Now shows both "Test Hospital - Hospital" and should show "Indiana Regional Medical Center"
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Test destination dropdown shows facilities

**Issue #2: Healthcare/EMS Registration CORS Error** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Location**: Registration forms (Healthcare and EMS)
- **Expected**: Registration should work in production
- **Actual**: CORS error - trying to call localhost:5001 from production
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded fetch() calls instead of using configured api instance
- **Impact**: Cannot register new users in production
- **Fix Applied**: Updated HealthcareRegistration.tsx, EMSRegistration.tsx, and UnitsManagement.tsx to use api instance
- **Deployed**: ‚úÖ Frontend redeployed to production (3rd deployment)
- **Healthcare Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Successfully created "Indiana Regional Medical Center"
- **EMS Status**: ‚ùå Backend 500 error - Server-side issue in EMS registration endpoint
